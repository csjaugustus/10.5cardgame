# 10.5 Card Game

10.5 is a poker card game in which each player picks a maximum of 5 cards, and tries to hit as close to 10.5 as possible without exceeding 10.5. Each player starts the game with an initial amount of tokens to bet, and the game will only end when one of them finishes their tokens. 

As of now I have not written the code for the latter part. The program ends after 1 round of game. There are also a number of minor problems in the code that may cause problems if the user does not input as required, or inputs wrongly. There is also no save game feature if the program is accidentally closed halfway.
